	\section{Wofür steht Space-Based Computing?}
		Space computing has its origin in parallel programming [6]. Here, a space is a place where data can be shared by multiple components. A component can easily put a piece of data to be shared with others into a space (“write”). Any number of components can read a piece of data without removing it from the space (“read”); a component may read the same piece of data even multiple times.	There is also a variant of reading data that removes data from the space once it is read (destructive read – referred too as “take”). 
		
		A space stores data persistently such that it is not lost when the environment
		realizes an outage. The data model supported by a space is that of a tuple, which
		is why a corresponding space is also referred to as tuple space (“TSpace” [15]).
		In a TSpace, data to be read (or taken) is identified by a template, i.e. by
		specifying values in certain slots of a
		tuple to be retrieved while other slots are
		left open; if more than one tuple will match a template only one will be returned
		from the space. To support more sophisticated applications, advanced features
		for manipulating tuples in a space are defined (e.g. [12]). Finally, matching of
		tuples to be retrieved from a space can be supported by associating semantics
		with each tuple (so-called “sTuples” [11]). 
		
		
		
		
		Similar to the Linda coordination model, SB
		C is mainly a data-driven coordination
		model, but can be adapted and used accordin
		g to control-driven c
		oordination models as
		well (section 4.3). As shown in Figure 18,
		application components running on different
		physical nodes coordinate each other by
		means of writing, reading, and removing
		(section 4.2.1) shared structured entries from a logically central space entity. SBC is a
		logical central architectural component a
		nd does not specify where it is physically
		located
		
		An implementation of the SBC architectural
		style can be deployed on a physical central
		server, or run on several nodes (Figure 19 and Figure 20, part 5). In the latter case,
		internal mechanisms have to make sure, that the shared data structures on the
		participating nodes are synchronized by ta
		king into account use case specific
		requirements
		
		For instance, a strategy may define that all node
		s have to host the same consistent data
		set. From the application co
		mponent’s point of view ther
		e is no client/server or P2P
		architectural style to worry about. The appl
		ication component has a specific role in a
		coordination policy (section 4.1.1) the component
		is part of and acts according to which
		has been defined explicitly by higher business goals or autonomously. The used
		coordination policy specifies the component’s
		role, whether it is a client requesting
		information or a server responding with data, or both. In the following, this thesis refers
		to the term “space” in the same
		way as to SBC. In the next
		sections, SBC’s coordination
		and agility capabilities are going to be de
		scribed briefly by means of Figure 20, and in
		more detail in section 4.2.4. 
		
		Distributed application components (Figure
		20, part 1) access the space by means of
		read
		,
		take
		, and
		destroy
		operations if they want to retr
		ieve and/or remove data, or by
		means of
		write
		operations in case of a
		dding data (section 4.2.1). The
		notify
		operation
		allows application components to be
		notified about changes in the space.
		Data placed in the space is stored in a
		structured way according to exchangeable
		coordination policies (Figure 20, part 3). Each
		policy is responsible
		to structure and
		maintain data in the space. Several coordi
		nation policies may exist at the same time,
		thus the same data may be structured di
		fferently, depending on the policy looking at. In
		its simplest form, such a policy is similar
		to the Tuple Space coordination model that
		uses template matching on structured tupl
		es. Other policies may involve FIFO, LIFO,
		keys, geo-coordinates, or even more complex
		coordination like the ma
		rket place pattern.
		Writing data using the last pol
		icy could mean e.g., to announce a new offer about which
		other application components
		are notified in near-time.
		The efficiency of coordinating application
		components mainly rests upon the efficiency
		of the coordination policy. Internal mech
		anisms have to allow access of multiple
		concurrent operations while preserving
		consistency. The way of managing
		synchronizations and their gra
		nularity depends on the repr
		esented policy and therefore
		requires careful trade-off analyzes. 
		
		
		\subsection{Unterschied zwischen SBC und Cloudcomputing}
			Cloud computing refers to the hosting of applications on a large data center, that allows the application to use as much of the provided computing power as needed for any given time. Different cloud computing providers (e.g. Google or Amazon) provide different APIs for the hosted applications.
			
			Space based computing on the other hand, is not so much about the hosting, but more about the communication of components of a distributed system. The "space" is basically a centralized data channel through which distributed components publish and consume data. This is supposed to simplify distributed application concerns (transaction handling, reliable communication, etc.) when components do not need to interact directly with each other.
			
			An application running on a cloud platform is (almost certainly) accessible via the Internet. That is not necessarily the case with space based computing.
